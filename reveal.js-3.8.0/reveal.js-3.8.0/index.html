						Scrum In a nutshell<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Split your organization into small, cross-functional, selforganizing teams.</li>
							<li>Split your work into a list of small, concrete deliverables. Sort the list by priority and estimate the relative effort of each item.</li>
							<li>Split time into short fixed-length iterations (usually 1 â€“ 4 weeks), with potentially shippable code demonstrated after each iteration.</li>
							<li>Optimize the release plan and update priorities in collaboration with the customer</li>
							<li>Optimize the process by having a retrospective after each iteration.</li>
						</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Beginning of iteration: an iteration plan is created. Team pulls out specific items from the product backlog, based on product owner's priorities</li>
						<li>During iteration: Team focuses on completing the items they committed to</li>
						<li>End of iteration: Team demonstrates working code to the relevant stakeholders, this code should be potentially shippable. Then the teams conducts a retrospective</li>

					<ul>
