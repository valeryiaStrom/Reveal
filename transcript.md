# Transcript for presentation

Hello. My name is Valeryia. I am a Senior Software Testing Engineer. I work at EPAM Systems already for 3,5 years.
And today I’m going to speak about Scrum.
`New slide`
So what is Scrum?
`New slide`
Scrum – is a methodology. And what is a methodology? 
`New slide`
Methodology – is a way of doing smth. In our case it’s a way of building a software. We can also say that methodology – is like a recipe.
When we cook, f.e. apple pie, we need a recipe. Some instructions how to cook a pie based on experience of many generations. 
So development methodology is like a recipe – summarized instructions based on experience in software development.
And now I’m going to give you just a quick review of methodologies.
`New slide`
All software development methodologies can be divided into 2 categories:
1.	Traditional
2.	Agile
`New slide`
Traditional software development methodologies are based on pre-organized stages of the software development lifecycle. Here the flow of development goes straight from requirements to design and then to development, then to testing and maintenance. (example: Waterfall, Rational Unified Process)
Unlike the traditional approaches of SDLC, Agile approaches are precise and customer friendly. Users/Customers have the opportunity to make modifications throughout project development phases.
Agile proposes an incremental and iterative approach to development. (Scrum, Kanban)
So Scrum – is an Agile software development methodology.
`New slide`
Also we can comparee methodologies by the measure of how prescriptive they are. Prescriptive means “how many rules they provide.” And, on the contrary, adaptive means “less rules to follow”. 100% prescriptive means you don’t; have to use tour brain, there is a rule for everything. 100% adaptive means do whatever.
`New slide`
If we draw an imaginable line representing the strictness of all methodologies we can see that Scrum actually is not the most ‘Agilish’ or not most adaptive. Interestingly enough, the value of a tool is that it limits your options.
So today I’m not going to tell you what roles exist in Scrum, or what ceremonies are usually conducted. I’m going to speak about Scrum from the perspective of what it prescribes.
`New slide`
So again what is Scrum? (apart from being a methodology)
Scrum In a nutshell
-	Split your organization into small, cross-functional, selforganizing teams.
-	Split your work into a list of small, concrete deliverables. Sort the list by priority and estimate the relative effort of each item.
-	Split time into short fixed-length iterations (usually 1 – 4 weeks), with potentially shippable code demonstrated after each iteration.
-	Optimize the release plan and update priorities in collaboration with the customer
-	Optimize the process by having a retrospective after each iteration.
So instead of a large group spending a long time building a big thing, we have a small team spending a short time building a small thing. But integrating regularly to see the whole. 
So when do we need to build our process in a Scrum way?
Scrum is neither perfect nor complete. It doesn’t tell you everything that you need to do, they just provide certain constraints & guidelines. 
So what does Scrum prescribe?
`New slide`
Scrum prescribes roles
Scrum prescribes 3 roles: 
1)	Product Owner (sets product vision & priorities)
2)	Team (implements the product) and 
3)	Scrum Master (provides process leadership).
Apart from that in Scrum you are free to add whatever additional roles you need. Be careful when adding roles though, make sure the additional roles actually add value and don’t conflict with other elements of the process. Are you sure you need that Project Manager role? In a big project maybe that’s a great idea, but In a small project that role might be a waste, or worse, might lead to sub-optimization and micromanagement. The general idea in Scrum is “less is more”. So when in doubt, start with less.
`New slide`
Scrum prescribes timeboxed iterations
Scrum is based on timeboxed iterations. You can choose the length of the iteration, but the general idea is to keep the same length of iteration over a period of time.
`New slide`
+ Beginning of iteration: An iteration plan is created, team pulls out specific number of items from the product backlog, based on the product owner’s priorities and how much the team thinks they can complete in one iteration. 
+ During iteration: Team focuses on completing the items they committed to. The scope of the iteration is fixed.
+ End of iteration: Team demonstrates working code to the relevant stakeholders, ideally this code should be potentially shippable (i.e. tested and ready to go). Then the team does a retrospective to discuss and improve their process. 
`New slide`
Scrum limits WIP per iteration
In Scrum, the sprint backlog shows what tasks are to be executed during the current iteration (= “sprint” in Scrum-speak). This is commonly represented using cards on the wall, called a Scrum board or Task board. 
So what actually does this mean? For better understanding lets compare with Kanban
Here’s a simple example of boards: In both cases we’re tracking a bunch of items through a workflow. There are three columns on the boards: To Do, Ongoing, and Done. So what’s the difference between these two sample boards then? The little 2(two) in the middle column on the kanban board. That’s all. That 2 means “there may be no more than 2 items in this column at any given moment”. In Scrum there is no rule preventing the team from putting all items into the Ongoing column at the same time! However there is an implicit limit since the iteration itself has a fixed scope. In this case the implicit limit per column is 4, since there are only 4 items on the whole board. So Scrum limits WIP indirectly, while Kanban limits WIP directly.
`New slide`
Scrum is empirical
Scrum is empirical in the sense that you are expected to experiment with the process and customize it to your environment. In fact, you have to experiment. Scrum doesn’t provide all the answers – it just gives you a basic set of constraints to drive your own process improvement:
`New slide`
+ Scrum says you should have cross-functional teams. So who should be on what team? Don’t know, experiment. 
+ Scrum says the team chooses how much work to pull into a sprint. So how much should they pull in? Don’t know, experiment. 
+ Scrum says you should limit WIP. So what should the limit be? Don’t know, experiment.
So let’s say we reduce a WIP limit, based on the theory that this will improve our process. We then observe how things like capacity, lead time and quality change. We draw conclusions from the results and then change some more things, continuously improving our process. 
`New slide`
The most critical element of this is the feedback loop. Change something => Find out how it went => Learn from it => Change something again. In Scrum, the basic feedback loop is a sprint
`New slide`
Scrum resists changes within an iteration
Let’s say our Scrum board looks like this:
What if someone turns up and wants to add E to the board?
A Scrum team will typically say something like “No, sorry, we’ve committed to A+B+C+D this sprint. But feel free to add E to the product backlog. If the product owner considers it to be high priority we will pull this into next sprint.” Sprints of the right length give the team just enough focused time to get something done, while still allowing the product owner to manage and update priorities on a regular basis.
`New slide`
Scrum board is reset between each iteration
A Scrum board typically looks something like this during different stages of a sprint:
When the sprint is over, the board is cleared – all items are removed. A new sprint is started and after the sprint planning meeting we have a new Scrum board, with new items in the left-most column. Technically this is waste, but for experienced Scrum teams this usually doesn’t take too long, and the process of resetting the board can give a nice sense of accomplishment and closure. Sort of like washing dishes after dinner – doing it is a pain but it feels nice afterwards.
`New slide`
Scrum prescribes cross-functional teams
A Scrum board is owned by exactly one Scrum team. A Scrum team is cross-functional, it contains all the skills needed to complete all the items in the iteration.
`New slide` 
Scrum backlog items must fit in a sprint
As we already know Scrum is based on incremental development, which means breaking the work into smaller pieces.
But a Scrum team will only commit to items that they think they can complete within one iteration (based on the definition of “Done”). If an item is too big to fit in a sprint, the team and product owner will try to find ways to break it into smaller pieces until it does fit. If items tend to be big, iterations will be longer (although usually no longer than 4 weeks).
`New slide`
Scrum prescribes estimation and velocity
Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can do during a single Sprint and is the key metric in Scrum. Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed User Stories.
Knowing the average velocity is nice, because then we can make realistic predictions about which items we can complete in upcoming sprints, and therefore make realistic release plans.
`New slide`
Scrum is Lean and Agile
I’m not going to go through Lean Thinking and the Agile Manifesto here, but generally speaking Scrum is very well aligned with those values and principles. For example:
+ Scrum is pull scheduling system, which corresponds to the JIT (Just In Time) principle of Lean. This means that the team chooses when and how much work to commit to, they “pull” work when they are ready, rather than having it “pushed” in from the outside. Just like a printer pulls in the next page only when it is ready to print on it (although there is a small & limited batch of paper that it can pull from).
+ Scrum is based on continuous and empirical process optimization, which corresponds to the Kaizen principle of Lean.
+ Scrum emphasizes responding to change over following a plan, one of the four values of the agile manifesto.
.. and more. 
From one perspective Scrum can be seen as not-so-lean because it prescribes batching items into timeboxed iterations. But that depends on the length of your iteration, and what you are comparing to. Compared to a more traditional process where we perhaps integrate and release something 2 – 4 times per year, a Scrum team producing shippable code every 2 weeks is extremely lean.
`New slide`
Scrum prescribes a prioritized product backlog
In Scrum, prioritization is always done by sorting the product backlog, and changes to priorities take effect in the next sprint (not the current sprint).
`New slide`
In Scrum, daily meetings are prescribed
A Scrum team has a short meeting (at most 15 minutes) every day at the same time & same place. The purpose of the meeting is to spread information about what is going on, plan the current day’s work, and identify any significant problems. This is sometimes called a daily standup, since it is usually done standing.
In Scrum the format of the meeting is people-oriented - every person reports one by one. If we compare it, f.e. with Kanban, Kanban teams usually focuse on bottlenecks and other visible problems and it might not be necessary have to hear everyone speak.
`New slide`
In Scrum, burndown charts are prescribed
It’s a visual representation of how much work remains in the current iteration and it’s a primary tool for tracking the progress.
The unit of the Y-axis is the same as the unit used on the sprint tasks. Typically hours or days or story points. 
The main purpose of a burndown chart is to easily find out as early as possible if we are behind or ahead of schedule, so that we can adapt.
`New slide`
So why scrum?
`New slide`
+ The scrum framework itself is simple. The rules, artifacts, events, and roles are easy to understand. 
+ The organization of complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects. Also, the clear demarcation of roles and planned events ensure that there is transparency and collective ownership throughout the development cycle. 
+ Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
